I'm a PhD student working in cryptography at the Yale Applied Cryptography Lab (YACL), advised by Dr. Charalampos Papamanthou. My research efforts are mainly focused in improving Private Information Retrieval (PIR) algorithms. The end goals would be an affordable private search over large databases. This would be extremely useful both to perform lightweight private operations in a decentralized setting, would allow for affordable privacy guarantees in the internet, and would improve many other Privacy Enhancing Technologies which PIR is used as a blackbox for.

Other topics in cryptography that interest me include secure aggregation, differential privacy, secure multiparty computation and homomorphic encryption.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use Font Awesome icons, Font-Awesome in github, and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
