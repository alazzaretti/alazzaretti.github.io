I'm a PhD student working in cryptography at the Yale Applied Cryptography Lab (YACL), advised by Dr. Charalampos Papamanthou. My research efforts are mainly focused in improving Private Information Retrieval algorithms to a point where it is actually used out in the wild. We are not far!

Other topics in cryptography that interest me include differential privacy, secure multiparty computation and consensus.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
