% abstract="In Private Information Retrieval (PIR), a client wishes to access an index i from a public n-bit database without revealing any information about i. Recently, a series of works starting with the seminal paper of Corrigan-Gibbs and Kogan (EUROCRYPT 2020) considered PIR with client preprocessing and no additional server storage. In this setting, we now have protocols that achieve {\$}{\$}{\backslash}widetilde{\{}O{\}}({\backslash}sqrt{\{}n{\}}){\$}{\$}O{\textasciitilde}(n)(amortized) server time and {\$}{\$}{\backslash}widetilde{\{}O{\}}(1){\$}{\$}O{\textasciitilde}(1)(amortized) bandwidth in the two-server model (Shi et al., CRYPTO 2021) as well as {\$}{\$}{\backslash}widetilde{\{}O{\}}({\backslash}sqrt{\{}n{\}}){\$}{\$}O{\textasciitilde}(n)server time and {\$}{\$}{\backslash}widetilde{\{}O{\}}({\backslash}sqrt{\{}n{\}}){\$}{\$}O{\textasciitilde}(n)bandwidth in the single-server model (Corrigan-Gibbs et al., EUROCRYPT 2022). Given existing lower bounds, a single-server PIR scheme with {\$}{\$}{\backslash}widetilde{\{}O{\}}({\backslash}sqrt{\{}n{\}}){\$}{\$}O{\textasciitilde}(n)(amortized) server time and {\$}{\$}{\backslash}widetilde{\{}O{\}}(1){\$}{\$}O{\textasciitilde}(1)(amortized) bandwidth is still feasible, however, to date, no known protocol achieves such complexities. In this paper we fill this gap by constructing the first single-server PIR scheme with {\$}{\$}{\backslash}widetilde{\{}O{\}}({\backslash}sqrt{\{}n{\}}){\$}{\$}O{\textasciitilde}(n)(amortized) server time and {\$}{\$}{\backslash}widetilde{\{}O{\}}(1){\$}{\$}O{\textasciitilde}(1)(amortized) bandwidth. Our scheme achieves near-optimal (optimal up to polylogarithmic factors) asymptotics in every relevant dimension. Central to our approach is a new cryptographic primitive that we call an adaptable pseudorandom set: With an adaptable pseudorandom set, one can represent a large pseudorandom set with a succinct fixed-size key k, and can both add to and remove from the set a constant number of elements by manipulating the key k, while maintaining its concise description as well as its pseudorandomness (under a certain security definition).",

In their recent seminal work, Corrigan-Gibbs and Kogan (EUROCRYPT 2020) introduced the first two-server PIR protocol with sublinear amortized server time and sublinear O(NlogN) bandwidth. In a followup work, Shi et al. (CRYPTO 2021) reduced the bandwidth to polylogarithmic by proposing a construction based on privately puncturable pseudorandom functions, a primitive whose only construction known to date is based on heavy cryptographic primitives such as LWE. Partly because of this, their PIR protocol does not achieve concrete efficiency. In this paper we propose TreePIR, a two-server PIR protocol with sublinear amortized server time and polylogarithmic bandwidth whose security can be based on just the DDH assumption. TreePIR can be partitioned in two phases that are both sublinear: The first phase is remarkably simple and only requires pseudorandom generators. The second phase is a single-server PIR protocol on onlyN indices, for which we can use the protocol by Döttling et al. (CRYPTO 2019) based on DDH, or, for practical purposes, the most concretely efficient single-server PIR protocol. Not only does TreePIR achieve better asymptotics than previous approaches while resting on weaker cryptographic assumptions, it also outperforms existing two-server PIR protocols in practice. The crux of our protocol is a new cryptographic primitive that we call weak privately puncturable pseudorandom functions, which we believe can have further applications.},
